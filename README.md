This is a project developed completelty in excel. 
In this project we take a data where the information of the sale and purchase of bike and the detail of each customer is given over a year. Details like the age, marital status, gender, income, region and their college degrees is included. For simplicity purposes I have included the the raw dataset in this excel file by the name Bike_buyers.
Overall what we do in this project is clean the raw data using excel and then create pivot tables and charts for outr dashboards. Finally, we create a dsahboard for interactive purposes. 
This way the data can be further used for analysis and the visualizations give the user aclear idea nad understanding of the in depth of the data.
